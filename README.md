To reproduce our results, download the repository and install the required Python packages:

``` sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/witiko/Word2Bits-evaluation.git
rm vectors/*.log analogy/!(Makefile) analogy_bitwise/!(Makefile)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, open the file [`evaluation.ipynb`](evaluation.ipynb) in [Jupyter
notebook][jupyter] and run all cells.
